Moved all the files and did a lot of data cleaning. I need to continue cleaning through the safegraph data, I think something else interesting to do will be to use the safegraph data to make some unsupervised clustering of types of schools just by text. Currently I have organized the schools by elementary schools, middle schools, high schools, colleges, and charter schools just based on some of the text abbreviations. I'll need to continue working through this though. 

completed tasks
[x] Organize education institutions by High School, Middle School, College, Elementary school, Charter School
[x] OTP files loaded into Github
[x] geometry data also loaded into Github

To Do
[] find a way to organize the "uncategorized" schools. Perhaps some textmining solutions or structural topic modelling may be helpful here
[] Start pulling historic census data on the region. Use the tidycensus to pull race data.
[] Make sure the OTP works on your laptop
